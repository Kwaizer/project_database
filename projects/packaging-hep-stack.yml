shortdescription: Packaging the HEP simulation stack on conda-forge
description: >
  One common toolchain used in high energy physics for simulation is: MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, PYTHIA8, Delphes. Installing these tools can be challenging at times,
  especially for new users. The conda-forge packaging infrastructure system and package registry allows for distribution of complex binaries across multiple
  platforms though the Conda package management ecosystem. As ROOT and the PYTHIA8 library with Python bindings have been successfully packaged and distributed
  on conda-forge it should be possible to package all the components of the HEP simulation stack and distribute them on conda-forge. Packaging these
  components will allow them to have the ability to not only be installed as individual tools, but also be installed together in a coherent package environment.
